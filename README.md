# Remit
A remittance is a transfer of money, often by a foreign worker to an individual in their home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with international aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries.

Remit is a peer-to-peer payment system with a quick one time set up process. Once you create an account, either through SMS or the website, making a transaction takes only a couple of seconds.
